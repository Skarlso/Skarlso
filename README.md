### Distributed Face Recognition Service

I'm also working on [Kube Project](https://kubeproject.app) which is a sample application for a distributed service structure that can be deployed on Kubernetes.
It's using tilt so deployment and usage is super simple.

The project aims to bring the world of distributed software closer to starting developers.
