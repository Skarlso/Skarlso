### Distributed Face Recognition Service

I'm also working on [Kube Project](https://kubeproject.app) which is a sample application for a distributed service structure that can be deployed on Kubernetes.
It's using [tilt](https://tilt.dev/) so deployment and usage are super simple.

The project aims to bring the world of distributed software closer to starting developers.
